# "Personal" CDN

A staging area to dump publicly accessible (non-secret) static assets for various reasons, such as:

* CSS, JS, ES6 modules, or images for use in various locations, such as demonstrations on [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io), a tool [I use fairly heavily](https://codepen.io/amcgregor).

* Fonts for use in the same, or by iOS applications capable of importing fonts for application use via CSS declarations or direct URL to the font file itself.

Current contents include:

* A "base" or "reset" CSS combining a slightly modernized "Meyers Reset" with a few "theme" custom properties defined, and basic English/French language-awareness.

* Hasklug, Hasklig for those who need "promptline symbols" and a metric f-ton of vector icons. Which vector icons? All the vector icons.
